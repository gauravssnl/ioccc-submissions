### Positive

That's just another Hello World. But with heavy restrictions, no keywords, no numbers, no strings or literals, only 3 operations: x(!=0), x++, x+=y. Inspired by the "addleq" OISC.

You can suppress compiler warnings by replacing the first line with this:

```c
unsigned              P,o,S,i,t,I,v,E;                   int
```
