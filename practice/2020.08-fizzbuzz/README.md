### FizzBuzz

Imagine that you apply for a job at Obfuscate Inc. and they ask you to write a simple program to prove your skills.

- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

How will you write it?
