### Hattifatteners

This is a rewrite of [Kate's work](https://gist.github.com/katef/f52978b2ba4583d195414f19342d91ca).

I was trying to make it look like the creatures this script draws to svg. This is Hattifattener, a ghost-like creature from the tales of the Moomins. But to you it may seem like a sausage with wings.

Has two command line arguments, the first is the number of hattifatteners (default 50) and the second is a random seed (default is the current unix time).
